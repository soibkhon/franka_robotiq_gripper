The base numbers were taken from the gripper manual and the measurements of custom mount added, the weight was calculated manually.

Intertia matrix is taken from the manual

The mount is 0.05m and it was added to Z axis of the Center of mass vector, also the distance between the mounting point of end-effector untill the gripping point centre was measured and added to the translational matrix. The end-effector is rotated about -45 degrees, it was counted into the translational matrix too.
